### Reducers
* Create a new folder called reducers
* Create a file in this folder called index.js
* Import combineReducers from redux
* Create a reducer function for each piece of data in state.js
  * newComments
  * newTasks
  * newOrders
  * tickets
  * orders
  * tasks
  * messages
* Remember 2 parameters state and action. Remember to return state
* Combine the reducers and export
<!-- Done with Reducers -->


### Create Database
* Create a store.js file
* Import createStore from redux
* Import state from state.js
* Import reducers from reducers/index
* Create the store and export it
<!-- Done with store.js -->

### Provide store to components
* In index.js
* Import Provider from react-redux
* Import store from store.js
* Use Provider component to wrap App
* Give Provider a prop “store” and the value of the store
<!-- Done here. Still works! -->

### Create Containers
* In each Container:
* Import connect from react-redux
* Create a function called mapStateToProps that takes parameter state
* Return an object. Decide what prop the component needs and this will be a key on the object
* Decide what data from state the component needs and that will be the value on the object
* Use the connect function and mapStateToProps to turn the component into a container
* Export the container

### ONLY make these components into Containers
<!-- * Tickets (use as example) -->
<!-- * TransactionPanel -->
<!-- * TopNav -->
<!-- * TasksPanel -->
<!-- * Comments -->
* Orders
* Tasks

### Think - Why do the other components not care about the database such that we don't need to make them Containers??

### Fix
* In App.js remove the props parameter and all instances of passing props
* In index.js remove all instances of state and passing props to App
